Project 5 in Fys3150: Computaitonal physics for candidate 14.
-candidate14.pdf is the report.\n
-const.cpp is the file for 1d constant step MC simulation.\n
-comake is the make file for const.cpp\n
-gauss.cpp is the file for 1d gaussian step MC simulation.\n
-gmake is the make file for gauss.cpp\n
-2dgauss.cpp is the file for 2d gaussian step MC simulation.\n
-2dmake is the make file for 2dgauss.cpp\n
-2dpde.cpp is the file for 2d PDE solvers.\n
-pdemake is the make file for 2dpde.cpp\n

The rest of the files are scripts for plotting and such and should not be 
considered part of the project.
